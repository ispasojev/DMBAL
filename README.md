Diverse Mini-Batch Active Learning Using Boundary Points

- Deep learning algorithm which optimizes the performance while reducing the amount of required labeled data
- Selects most informative data points to be labeled by first clustering and then detecting data points close to the cluster boundaries
- Then, labels are obtained for those data points which are closest to the cluster boundaries
